# palindrome-bot

This is a reddit bot which will detect any palindromes in the comments of a post. Then it will reply "You used the word <something> which is a palindrome".
<br><br>
- The code is very sketchy because this my first time writing in python
<br><br>
- ```palindrome-results.txt``` is the file where the comment ids -- of comments the bot has replied to will -- be stored to prevent the bot from repying to the same comment more than once.
<br><br>
- To use this bot you need to put yor username, password, client id and client secret on the ```praw.ini``` file
